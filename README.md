# Miox: The Discord Virtual Assistant for Poly-Out 🎓🤖

Welcome to Miox, a Discord bot designed to help my student committee stay organized and efficient. Developed with love and care, Miox leverages the power of automation to handle repetitive tasks, ensuring that the team can focus on what truly matters 🌈.

## 🎯 Project Overview

Miox was born out of my experience as the chair of Poly-Out for two years. Understanding the complexity of how committees work at Polytechnique and the motivation of volunteers, I wanted to use my software engineering background to create a virtual assistant that streamlines our processes. By integrating with Discord and Google Drive, Miox automates various tasks, making committee work more manageable and enjoyable.

## 🚀 Features

### 1. Automated Folder and Document Creation 📂📄
When a member creates a `channel` in Discord to represent an event, Miox automatically sets up the necessary folders and documents in Google Drive, ensuring everything is organized from the start.

### 2. Organized Threads for New Channels 📌
To maintain a clutter-free Discord server, Miox creates default `threads` within new channels and notifies the relevant teams. This keeps everyone in the loop and ensures that all discussions are neatly categorized.

### 3. Enhanced Communication 📢
Special attention has been given to how messages are crafted, encouraging team members to read and engage with them, fostering a more interactive and collaborative environment.

### 4. Receipt Management for Events 🧾
After an event, members can upload pictures of receipts to a dedicated thread. Miox compiles these receipts into a PDF and uploads it to Google Drive, streamlining the treasurer’s task of collecting and sending receipts to accounting.

### 5. Photo Organization 📸
Members can upload event photos to a dedicated thread, and Miox will transfer these pictures to Google Drive. This ensures that all event memories are preserved and easily accessible.

## 🔧 Technology Stack

- **Discord API**: 14.14.1
- **Google API**: 134.0.0

## 🛠️ Current Development

I am currently reworking the codebase to improve its design and ensure that Miox is as efficient and reliable as possible.

Note: Yes, I named the bot after myself. 🎉💪
